# outside-nni

The contents of this directory are an experiment looking into if GP could be used to judge the quality of NNI additions to the DAG.

These results are not described in our manuscript, and will be described using a different implementation in future work. Thus, the code here is not curated for outside use and is just kept as part of the record.
